                <p>I grew up playing titles like Minecraft and Star Wars Battlefront, but I really fell 
                    in love with the medium when my partner and I bought our first PCs during the 
                    COVID-19 pandemic. 
                    In the thick of social distancing, the best way to stay connected with our 
                    friends was to hop online and play silly multiplayer games. Now that our friends 
                    live in different parts of the world, video games help us stay connected despite the 
                    distance.
                    Most of my close friends (8/10, to be exact) identify as LGBTQ+. 
                    Though we don’t seek out games purely based on LGBTQ+ representation, 
                    it is always nice to to see yourself in the media you care about.

                    In Baldur’s Gate 3–an adaptation of Dungeons and Dragons’ 5e 
                    system–your character customization allows you to choose from a 
                    variety of gender expressions, and you’re given freedom with your 
                    romance options. Outside of the great self-insert potential, though, 
                    it’s just an incredible game. As of 2025, it has an Overwhelmingly 
                    Positive rating on Steam (the highest possible!) with <b>over 426,000 reviews.</b>

            <p>In addition to BG3 (which I have over 430 hours in), some of my other favorite 
                games include Elden Ring (166 hours) and Monster Hunter Rise (145 hours). All 
                of these RPGs have amazing combat systems, great art direction, and are a 
                great time with friends. </p>

        <p>This Steam group, founded on March 16th, 2024, was created by a group of gamers dedicated to “identify[ing]” whether a game has Woke content.” The moderators define this content as “any images, messages, characters, storytelling, dialogue, music, or game mechanics that include themes associated with the left-side of the political 
            aisle in contemporary western politics.” 
        As of 2025, there are <b>12,333 members</b> of this group.</p>

        <p>Games that are reviewed are placed into three different categories. 
            “Recommended” games have no woke themes present. The “Informational” 
            games have woke themes, but are more subtle than the “Not Recommended” 
            category, which have “overt messaging.” As of late 2025, their full list 
            contains nearly <b>1700 titles</b>–most of which are Not Recommended. 
        <br></br>The goal of this project was not only to determine how many games were flagged as “woke”, but to identify the most common reasons for this rating. Using their criteria, I also assigned a score to each title based on how many categories they were flagged for, allowing me to compile a list of the “wokest” games!

        <h4>From here on, I'll be referring to "informational" games as "slightly woke"; it feels less confusing to me.</h4>
        <p>Queer content was the overwhelming reason for the “woke” rating. Many role-playing games (RPGs), like Elden Ring, were flagged for using body type A/B rather than explicitly male or female.</p>

            This rating was often based on just the presence of LGBTQ+ content or 
            individuals–like in the above case of BTD6, where the inclusion of pride flags 
            was enough to make the game “Not Recommended.” The moderators’ interpretation of 
            “overt” vs “subtle” representation is also confusing. Some games are flagged as 
            Slightly woke for having gay characters, while others are flagged as Woke for 
            having A/B body type options. A quote from the discussion under their Methodology 
            section gives some (uncomfortable) explanation.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
            <p>It might 'seem' more subtle, but anything with a 'body type' option, 
                as opposed to simply Male or Female, is blatantly woke - and should be 
                regarded as such. This is not something like occasional homosexuality in a 
                game, or other deviancy, or perhaps [POC] where they shouldn't be, etc. This 
                is a flagrant, and obvious expression of their attempt to steal and contrive 
                language - it should be marked as such at all times.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            According to a report by <a href="https://assets.glaad.org/m/5ab9a335d607edcd/original/2024-GLAAD-Gaming-Report.pdf">GLAAD</a>, 17% of gamers aged 13-55 identify as LGBTQ+–
            significantly higher than the 7% of Americans that identify as such. Yet their 
            analysis also states that games with LGBTQ+ characters or storylines only account 
            for <b>2% of all games.</b> Most LGBTQ+ gamers (74%) say that they can be their true selves when gaming, 
           and 66% say that gaming allows for expression they don’t feel comfortable with 
           in the real world.  
        </p>

        <h5>Representation in gaming helps people cope with the 
           discrimination and targeting LGBTQ+ people often face on a daily basis.</h5>

        <h3>The next highest reason was pro-DEI content, which was present in 26% of woke games and 17% of slightly woke games.</h3>
            <p>Again, the definition of “pro-DEI” seems to encompass any representation of 
                diverse identities in games. Both games in the Overcooked! 
                series were flagged for having a wheelchair-bound raccoon. The Woke 
                Content Detector really didn’t like that Dave the Diver’s sushi chef was 
                black–even though there are incredible, professionally trained black sushi 
                chefs like
                <a href="https://www.marisabaggett.com/about">Marisa Baggett</a> in the real world! </p>

        <p>A report by 
            <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/news-center/2018/nielsen-examines-the-digital-habits-and-impact-of-black-consumers/">Nielsen</a>
         states that <b>73% of black Americans identify as gamers,</b> 
            compared to 63% of the total population. Yet, despite how the Woke Content 
            Detector group feels, there is a noted absence of black characters, especially 
            black main characters, in video games. </p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            <p>“The absence of Black characters in games is a very serious problem. 
                Black kids aren’t seeing themselves as the heroes, they aren’t seeing 
                themselves solving the problems and wearing the capes. We deserve to feel

        <p>The rest of the categories were much less prevalent, with each 
            representing less than 5% of titles. Anti-capitalist sentiment was the 
            third highest category for woke games <b>(2.8%)</b>, while pro-climate action was

        "The game should obviously be labeled as "not recommended". Other gamers should not be getting tricked

        <P>"It blatantly pushes:</P>

        <ul>
            <li>
            pro-LGBTQ+ messaging:
            *The games refuses to refer to the protagonist as "he", instead the marketing prominently
            refers to the protagonist with pronouns calling him "they".
            *The game only has one confirmed relationship and of course these groomers had to
            make it ♥♥♥♥.
            </li>
            <li>
            pro-climate action messaging:
            *The game smears corporations extracting recourses from other planets as bad and
            harmful.
            </li>
            <li>
            pro-communism/socialism messaging:
            *One of the factions in game constantly refer to each other as "comrades". Apparently
            they were even blatantly called communist while the game was in development. And if
            the player sides with the communists, then the game starts referring to the player as a
            "hero" and "liberator".
            </li>
            <li>
            pro-immigration messaging:
            *The game is less overt about this one. But it pushes multipole times that illegal
            immigrants are accepted as a part of the culture they seek to invade.  
            </li>
            <li>
            pro-transhumanism messaging:
            *one of the endings the player forces transhumanism on humanity. After which the game
            starts playing a soundtrack called "stargazer", implying that the player forcing
            transhumanism on humanity is something good.  
            </li>
            <li>
            anti-western society messaging:
            again the game smears the western corporations as bad, while the "good" communist
            faction blatantly uses Armenian(Muslim) names.
            </li>
            <li>
            -anti-human messaging
            *When the player decides to pick the ending, where he protects Humanity, by eradicating the alien space herpes. Then the games narrator calls the protagonist a "monster".
            </li>
            <li>
            anti-colonialism messaging:
            *The game smears corporations colonizing a planet as bad.
            *The game features a colony ship (obviously made to colonize). The ending where the
            player decides to protect the colony ship is the one where he is smeared as a "monster".
            In the other two endings, the player decides to stop the colony ship from completing it´s
            mission. This includes the ending where the player is referred to as a "Hero" and
            "Liberator".    
            </li>
            <li>
            anti-capitalism messaging:
            *smears corporations as one dimensional evil.
            </li>
            <li>
            anti-heterosexual messaging
            *Again no heterosexual relationships. Only ♥♥♥♥´s.
            </li>
            <li>
            anti-patriarchy messaging
            *the game features multipole characters that are in patriarchal or fatherly like positions of
            power. The game displays the player and other characters rejecting their "father´s"
            wisdom and leadership as something good."

        <h2>What games are approved?</h2>
        <p>Out of the entire list, <b>only 388 games are recommended</b>, meaning they 
            contain no woke content. If you’re upset that Monster Hunter Wilds lets you choose between body types A and B, never fear; Monster Hunter World is (apparently) free of woke content! 
        You just need to ignore the series’ overarching themes of protecting the environment and balancing the ecosystem.
          You can also play all of the Freddi Fish, Putt Putt, and Pajama Sam games! These children’s games make up 5% of their recommended list. Though, not everyone seems to be happy with this rating: a discussion post from a mom on Steam highlights some of the hidden woke content in “Putt Putt Goes to the Moon”.  
        </p>

        <div class="grid">
            <p>"[A] while back I asked about what some good games were for my kids that didn’t have woke content. After reading through the comments I tried some and they seemed a little advanced for my kiddos unfortunately (ages 3 and 5). That’s when I stumbled upon these Humongous Entertainment games on the list! They seemed like exactly what I was looking for, not trying to impose anything on young minds. After playing a couple though we came to “Putt Putt Goes to the Moon” which seemed fine at first until a scene came up with a two headed alien. Each head was clearly a different sex and it left a bad taste in my mouth for sure. Clearly a “nonbionary” reference, we’ll continue trying other games but I’d recommend changing that one on the list."</p>

        <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
        <p>While it can be fun to poke at the ridiculousness of this list, the sentiment 
            behind these rankings is tied to damaging ideologies that are currently 
            harming marginalized communities around the world. Far-right parties fixate on 
            “anti-woke” politics–particularly LGBTQ+ rights–diverting attention from 
            other policy issues and creating a moral panic. In a time when the rights and 
            healthcare of transgender Americans are being threatened, immigrant families are 
            keeping their children home from school to avoid being targeted by ICE, and 
            long-standing civil rights tools are being dismantled, initiatives like the Woke 
            Content Detector normalize discrimination and hateful rhetoric.</p>
        
        <img src="images/woke content detector discussion post 1.png">
        <p>
            The members of the Woke Content Detector can choose not to engage with “woke” 
            content. <b>But representation isn’t woke–it’s reality.</b> Being LGBTQ+, BIPOC, or 
            disabled isn’t a choice, and gamers from marginalized communities use 
            representation to express themselves and cope with the harassment they face 
            from these same “anti-woke” individuals.
