        <h2 id="heading-1">The Woke Content Detector</h2>
        <p>This Steam group, founded on March 16th, 2024, was created by a group of gamers dedicated to “identify[ing]” whether a game has Woke content.” The moderators define this content as “any images, messages, characters, storytelling, dialogue, music, or game mechanics that include themes associated with the left-side of the political aisle in contemporary western politics.” </p>

        <p>Games that are reviewed are placed into three different categories. “Recommended” games have no woke themes present. The “Informational” games have woke themes, but are more subtle than the “Not Recommended” category, which have “overt messaging.” As of late 2025, their full list contains nearly 1700 titles–most of which are Not Recommended. 
        <br></br>The goal of this project was not only to determine how many games were flagged as “woke”, but to identify the most common reasons for this rating. Using their criteria, I also assigned a score to each title based on how many categories they were flagged for, allowing me to compile a list of the “wokest” games!

        <h3>83% of woke games and 79% of informational games were flagged for pro-LGBTQIA+ content.</h3>
        <h4>From here on, I'll be referring to "informational" games as "slightly woke"; it feels less confusing to me.</h4>
        <p>Queer content was the overwhelming reason for the “woke” rating. Many role-playing games (RPGs), like Elden Ring, were flagged for using body type A/B rather than explicitly male or female.</p>
        
        <div class="grid">

            <div class="card2">

                </div>
        </div>

        <p>The next highest reason was pro-DEI content, which was present in 26% of woke games and 17% of slightly woke games. Dave the Diver, an indie RPG about gathering ingredients for a sushi restaurant, was criticized for its “improbably diverse cast.”</p>
        <p>The rest of the categories were much less prevalent, with each representing less than 5% of titles. Anti-capitalist sentiment was the third highest category for woke games (2.8%), while pro-climate action was the third highest for slightly woke games (4.2%).</p>

        <P>"It blatantly pushes:</P>

        <ul>
            <li>
            pro-LGBTQ+ messaging:
            *The games refuses to refer to the protagonist as "he", instead the marketing prominently
            refers to the protagonist with pronouns calling him "they".
            *The game only has one confirmed relationship and of course these groomers had to
            make it ♥♥♥♥.
            </li>
            <li>
            pro-climate action messaging:
            *The game smears corporations extracting recourses from other planets as bad and
            harmful.
            </li>
            <li>
            pro-communism/socialism messaging:
            *One of the factions in game constantly refer to each other as "comrades". Apparently
            they were even blatantly called communist while the game was in development. And if
            the player sides with the communists, then the game starts referring to the player as a
            "hero" and "liberator".
            </li>
            <li>
            pro-immigration messaging:
            *The game is less overt about this one. But it pushes multipole times that illegal
            immigrants are accepted as a part of the culture they seek to invade.  
            </li>
            <li>
            pro-transhumanism messaging:
            *one of the endings the player forces transhumanism on humanity. After which the game
            starts playing a soundtrack called "stargazer", implying that the player forcing
            transhumanism on humanity is something good.  
            </li>
            <li>
            anti-western society messaging:
            again the game smears the western corporations as bad, while the "good" communist
            faction blatantly uses Armenian(Muslim) names.
            </li>
            <li>
            -anti-human messaging
            *When the player decides to pick the ending, where he protects Humanity, by eradicating the alien space herpes. Then the games narrator calls the protagonist a "monster".
            </li>
            <li>
            anti-colonialism messaging:
            *The game smears corporations colonizing a planet as bad.
            *The game features a colony ship (obviously made to colonize). The ending where the
            player decides to protect the colony ship is the one where he is smeared as a "monster".
            In the other two endings, the player decides to stop the colony ship from completing it´s
            mission. This includes the ending where the player is referred to as a "Hero" and
            "Liberator".    
            </li>
            <li>
            anti-capitalism messaging:
            *smears corporations as one dimensional evil.
            </li>
            <li>
            anti-heterosexual messaging
            *Again no heterosexual relationships. Only ♥♥♥♥´s.
            </li>
            <li>
            anti-patriarchy messaging
            *the game features multipole characters that are in patriarchal or fatherly like positions of
            power. The game displays the player and other characters rejecting their "father´s"
            wisdom and leadership as something good."

        <h2>What games are approved?</h2>
        <p>Out of the entire list, only 388 games are recommended, meaning they contain no woke content. If you’re upset that Monster Hunter Wilds lets you choose between body types A and B, never fear; Monster Hunter World is (apparently) free of woke content! 
        You just need to ignore the series’ overarching themes of protecting the environment and balancing the ecosystem.
          You can also play all of the Freddi Fish, Putt Putt, and Pajama Sam games! These children’s games make up 5% of their recommended list. Though, not everyone seems to be happy with this rating: a discussion post from a mom on Steam highlights some of the hidden woke content in “Putt Putt Goes to the Moon”.  
        </p>

        <div class="grid">
            <p>"[A] while back I asked about what some good games were for my kids that didn’t have woke content. After reading through the comments I tried some and they seemed a little advanced for my kiddos unfortunately (ages 3 and 5). That’s when I stumbled upon these Humongous Entertainment games on the list! They seemed like exactly what I was looking for, not trying to impose anything on young minds. After playing a couple though we came to “Putt Putt Goes to the Moon” which seemed fine at first until a scene came up with a two headed alien. Each head was clearly a different sex and it left a bad taste in my mouth for sure. Clearly a “nonbionary” reference, we’ll continue trying other games but I’d recommend changing that one on the list."</p>

        <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
        <p>While it can be fun to poke at the ridiculousness of this list, the sentiment behind these rankings is tied to damaging ideologies that are currently harming marginalized communities around the world. Far-right parties fixate on “anti-woke” politics–particularly LGBTQ+ rights–diverting attention from other policy issues and creating a moral panic. In a time when the rights and healthcare of transgender Americans are being threatened, immigrant families are keeping their children home from school to avoid being targeted by ICE, and long-standing civil rights tool are being dismantled, initiatives like the Woke Content Detector normalize discrimination and hateful rhetoric.</p>
