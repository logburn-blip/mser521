        <p>This Steam group, founded on March 16th, 2024, was created by a group of gamers dedicated to “identify[ing]” whether a game has Woke content.” The moderators define this content as “any images, messages, characters, storytelling, dialogue, music, or game mechanics that include themes associated with the left-side of the political aisle in contemporary western politics.” </p>

        <p>Games that are reviewed are placed into three different categories. “Recommended” games have no woke themes present. The “Informational” games have woke themes, but are more subtle than the “Not Recommended” category, which have “overt messaging.” As of late 2025, their full list contains nearly 1700 titles–most of which are Not Recommended. 
        <br></br> 
        <br>The goal of this project was not only to determine how many games were flagged as “woke”, but to identify the most common reasons for this rating. Using their criteria, I also assigned a score to each title based on how many categories they were flagged for, allowing me to compile a list of the “wokest” games!

                <h3><b>Bloons TD 6: WOKE</b></h3>
                <p>Bloons Tower Defense 6, a game where you control monkeys popping waves of balloons, was classified as Woke due to “overtly pro-LGBTQ+ messaging. There is a pride flag item available in the trophy store with a pro-pride message. Psi is referred to using they/them pronouns.”</p>
