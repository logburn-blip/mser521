<p>Sonic the Hedgehog (ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ Sonikku za Hejjihoggu) is the titular main protagonist of the Sonic the Hedgehog series and Sega's mascot. He is an anthropomorphic hedgehog known for his ability to run faster than the speed of sound, hence his name. As his species implies, Sonic can roll up into a concussive ball, primarily to attack enemies.
